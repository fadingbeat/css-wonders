            I am a software developer with two years experience in Software and
            Web Development. I have proven experience as a front-end developer
            on various projects. I understand the lifecycle of web development,
            and as a developer, I am included in all phases when working on a
            project. I can easily understand client's needs and deliver results
            based on them. My productivity is based on learning, motivation, and
            teamwork. I am not limited to certain frameworks or paradigm, I am
            flexible and open to new challenges. I am currently working as a
            Lead Architect at

          <h3>Mission Automate</h3>
          <h6>Lead Architect</h6>
          <p>
            I first started at Mission Automate as a programming intern, which
            quickly lead to further collaboration and extension of knowledge,
            skills and abilities. <br /><br />I was a part of Apprenticeship
            system, which is when I developed a sense of teaching and sharing my
            knowledge with others. <br /><br />
            Being promoted to Lead Developer gave me more confidence and
            motivation to continue doing what I love. Today as a Lead Architect,
            I am still continuously learning and adapting new skills, so that I
            can better contribute to the quality of software solutions that are
            essential in every successful business.

            is a project of designing a website for a jewelry designer in Slunj,
            Croatia. <br />
            <br />As a developer, I was provided with the website mockups and
            color palletes that were a starting point in developing.
            <br /><br />During the process, I have learned that communication
            and engagement of each person working on the project (including the
            owner of the project) are crucial and essential aspects that help in
            bringing the best results.
